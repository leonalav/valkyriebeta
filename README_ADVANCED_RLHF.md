## Introduction

This implementation provides a framework for enhancing language models with advanced reasoning capabilities using state-of-the-art RLHF techniques. The framework is designed to be modular, allowing you to select specific reasoning components to enhance.

Key features:
- Modular enhancement of different reasoning capabilities
- Support for multiple RLHF algorithms
- Synthetic data generation for low-resource scenarios
- Interactive guided mode for optimal configuration
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Constitutional AI alignment integration

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- 16GB+ RAM
- 10GB+ disk space
- Access to a pre-trained language model (local or HuggingFace)

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is to use the setup script:

```bash
# Install and check environment
python setup_and_run_rlhf.py --install_dependencies --verify_cuda --check_only

# Run RLHF training in guided mode
python setup_and_run_rlhf.py --model_path "your_model_or_huggingface_model" \
                            --output_dir "./enhanced_model" \
                            --mode "guided" \
                            --use_synthetic_data
```

## Setup and Configuration

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (if applicable)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration Options

The framework provides multiple ways to configure the enhancement process:

1. **Guided Mode**: Interactive CLI wizard that helps you configure the enhancement process step-by-step.
2. **Auto Mode**: Automated configuration based on model size and available resources.
3. **Custom Mode**: Full control via a configuration file.

Example configuration file (`config.json`):

```json
{
  "model": {
    "name": "your_model_path_or_huggingface_id",
    "tokenizer": "auto"
  },
  "components": ["math", "logical", "causal", "nlu"],
  "rlhf": {
    "algorithm": "PPO",
    "kl_coef": 0.1,
    "reward_model": "auto"
  },
  "training": {
    "batch_size": 8,
    "learning_rate": 1e-5,
    "num_epochs": 3,
    "optimizer": "AdamW",
    "scheduler": "cosine"
  },
  "data": {
    "use_synthetic": true,
    "custom_data_path": null,
    "validation_ratio": 0.1
  },
  "evaluation": {
    "metrics": ["accuracy", "consistency", "reasoning_steps"],
    "test_datasets": ["GSM8K", "LogiQA"]
  }
}
```

## Advanced RLHF Components

The framework includes several components that can be enhanced independently or together:

### 1. Mathematical Reasoning

Enhances the model's ability to solve mathematical problems through step-by-step reasoning, including:
- Arithmetic operations
- Algebra
- Geometry
- Probability
- Statistics

### 2. Logical Reasoning

Improves the model's capabilities in:
- Deductive reasoning
- Inductive reasoning
- Abductive reasoning
- Syllogistic reasoning
- Logical fallacy detection

### 3. Causal Reasoning

Strengthens the model's understanding of:
- Cause and effect relationships
- Counterfactual reasoning
- Temporal dependencies
- Intervention effects
- Structural causal models

### 4. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

Enhances:
- Contextual understanding
- Implicit meaning extraction
- Pragmatic inference
- Rhetorical device recognition
- Ambiguity resolution

### 5. Constitutional AI Alignment

Integrates principles for:
- Harmlessness
- Helpfulness
- Honesty
- Factuality
- Safety guardrails

## Training Process

The RLHF training process consists of several stages:

1. **Initialization**: Load the base model and prepare the environment.
2. **Preference Data Collection/Generation**: Either use provided preference data or generate synthetic preference pairs.
3. **Reward Model Training**: Train a reward model to predict human preferences.
4. **Policy Optimization**: Use the reward model to optimize the policy with RLHF algorithms.
5. **Evaluation**: Continuously evaluate the model on reasoning benchmarks.

### RLHF Algorithms

The implementation supports multiple RLHF algorithms:

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: The standard algorithm used in many RLHF implementations.
- **REINFORCE with KL penalty**: A simpler alternative with KL divergence to prevent policy drift.
- **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)**: A more recent algorithm that eliminates the need for an explicit reward model.
- **IPO (Implicit Preference Optimization)**: Another recent algorithm with improved sample efficiency.

## Evaluation

The framework includes comprehensive evaluation on various reasoning benchmarks:

- **GSM8K**: Grade school math problems
- **LogiQA**: Logical reasoning questions
- **BIG-Bench Hard**: Hard reasoning tasks from BIG-Bench
- **MMLU**: Massive Multitask Language Understanding
- **Custom Reasoning Test Suite**: Internal test suite covering all reasoning components

Each component is evaluated separately, and an overall reasoning score is provided.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Out of Memory Errors

- Reduce batch size
- Enable gradient checkpointing
- Use lower precision (fp16)
- Use smaller reward model

### Slow Training

- Increase batch size if memory allows
- Use fewer epochs with early stopping
- Enable mixed precision training
- Reduce evaluation frequency

### Divergence in Training

- Decrease learning rate
- Increase KL penalty coefficient
- Add gradient clipping
- Use smaller policy update steps

## Advanced Customization

For advanced users, the framework allows for extensive customization:

- Custom reward models
- Integration with human feedback loops
- Multi-objective optimization
- Custom synthetic data generators
- Distributed training support
