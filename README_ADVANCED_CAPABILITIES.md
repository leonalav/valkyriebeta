# Advanced Capabilities in the Valkyrie LLM Training Framework

This document provides an overview of the advanced capabilities integrated into the Valkyrie LLM training framework, specifically within the Kaggle training script (`kaggletrain.py`). These capabilities enhance the model's performance in various specialized tasks.

## Overview of Advanced Capabilities

The training framework now supports the following advanced capabilities:

1. **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Integration**: Enables the model to process and reason over graph-structured data alongside text.
2. **Numerical Precision**: Enhances mathematical computation accuracy using higher precision operations.
3. **Formal Verification**: Validates mathematical reasoning steps and proofs for correctness.
4. **Adaptive Reasoning**: Dynamically selects appropriate reasoning strategies based on input.

## Enabling Advanced Capabilities

Each capability can be enabled through command-line arguments when running `kaggletrain.py`.

## Architecture and Components

### GNN Integration

The GNN integration consists of:

1. **Graph Extraction**: Extracts graph structures from text data
2. **Graph Encoder**: Processes node and edge features using configurable GNN architectures
3. **Transformer-GNN Integration**: Combines graph representations with transformer hidden states

```
[Text Input] → [Transformer] → [Hidden States]
                                      ↓
[Graph Data] → [GNN Encoder] → [Graph Embeddings]
                                      ↓
                      [Integration Module] → [Enhanced Representation] → [Output]
```

### Numerical Precision Enhancement

The numerical precision module:

1. Detects mathematical content in the input
2. Enhances computation using higher-precision arithmetic
3. Applies numerically stable algorithms for critical operations

### Verification System

The verification module:

1. Validates mathematical reasoning steps
2. Checks intermediate calculations for correctness
3. Can generate formal proofs for verifiable claims
4. Provides verification metadata alongside outputs

### Adaptive Reasoning Controller

The adaptive reasoning system:

1. Analyzes input to determine optimal reasoning strategy
2. Supports multiple reasoning approaches:
   - Recursive reasoning
   - Tree-based reasoning
   - Symbolic reasoning
   - Knowledge-based reasoning
   - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
3. Dynamically selects and applies the appropriate reasoner

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Forward Method

The model's forward method is enhanced to:

1. Auto-detect content type that requires special handling
2. Route inputs through appropriate specialized modules
3. Integrate outputs from specialized paths
4. Provide additional metadata via the cache dictionary

### Dataset Modifications

The dataset is extended to:

1. Extract graph data from text when GNN is enabled
2. Cache and batch graph data efficiently
3. Use custom collation for handling heterogeneous data types

### Training Process Enhancements

The training process is enhanced to:

1. Initialize specialized modules based on configuration
2. Move all data (including graph data) to the appropriate device
3. Track and log advanced capability usage and metrics

## Custom Test Bench Format

For advanced evaluation, create a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "gnn": [
    {
      "text": "Question about a graph structure",
      "graph": {
        "nodes": ["A", "B", "C"],
        "edges": [["A", "B"], ["B", "C"]]
      },
      "expected_answer": "Expected response"
    }
  ],
  "numerical_precision": [
    {
      "text": "Calculate 0.1 + 0.2 with high precision.",
      "expected_answer": "0.3",
      "precision_required": true
    }
  ],
  "verification": [
    {
      "text": "Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 15, showing all steps.",
      "expected_answer": "x = 5",
      "verification_required": true
    }
  ],
  "adaptive_reasoning": [
    {
      "text": "Complex reasoning question",
      "reasoning_type": "causal",
      "complexity": "high",
      "expected_answer": "Optional expected answer"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Considerations

Enabling these advanced capabilities can impact training and inference performance:

- **Memory Usage**: GNN and verification components increase memory requirements
- **Computation Time**: Advanced numerical precision may slow down mathematical operations
- **Batch Size**: You may need to reduce batch size when multiple capabilities are enabled

## Combining Capabilities

These capabilities can be used individually or combined for more powerful models:

1. **GNN + Verification**: For verified reasoning over graph structures
2. **Numerical Precision + Verification**: For highly accurate and verified mathematical computations
3. **Adaptive Reasoning + GNN**: For dynamic reasoning approaches over graph-structured data

## Limitations and Known Issues

- GNN integration requires properly structured graph data or extraction
- Numerical precision enhancements may not benefit all types of calculations
- Verification has overhead and may slow down inference
- Not all reasoning strategies may be available for every model architecture
